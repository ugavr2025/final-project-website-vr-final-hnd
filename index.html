    <h2>About ClassVR</h2>
    <div class="project-description">
      <p>
        ClassVR is an immersive virtual reality learning platform that
        transports students into a shared digital classroom, replacing isolating
        video calls with a true sense of presence.

      <h2>Motivation</h2>
      <p>
        One of the courses that would benefit from collaboration and guidance
        but was difficult to administer such activities over virtual environments
        is mathematics. With professors unable to actively see students' progress
        and catch mistakes quicker, and without a streamlined process for
        students to collaborate with other on math problems, similar to how some
        lectures are conducted in traditional classroom environments, many
        students found it difficult to actively engage with the material or get
        unstuck on math problems in isolated environments.
      </p>
      <p>
        ClassVR focuses on provides students a virtual, collaborative platform
        to engage with other students and the professor in an environment that
        mimics the environment of a traditional classroom. With a class
        whiteboard, professors can see where students are at when solving
        problems, and students can feel as if they are learning in a classroom.
        ClassVR breaks the isolation of virtual classes and bridges minds
        together to make virtual learning engaging.

      <h2>Features</h2>
      <p>
        <h3>Classroom Environment</h3>
        Upon joining the classroom, students can find their seat, similar to how
        students enter a traditional classroom. Each student is given an avatar in the virtual environment.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Students can view the
        professor's screen or camera, where professors can give lectures. The
        classroom is also built to have active learning, where professors and
        students can flip through a set of questions on the board, and students
        have access to a shared whiteboard to solve math problems. 
        
        <h3>Monitoring Progress</h3>
        Professors
        can use the headset and join the classroom to monitor students'
        progress and engagement. 
        
        <h3>AI Assistant</h3>
        To help students get assistance as efficient and effective as
        possible, an AI bot is available for students to use. Students can go to
        the bot and verbally ask questions, and the bot will respond back with
        helpful suggestions and clarifications on concepts.
        
        <h3>Accessibility</h3>
        The environment is
        set up to be accessible in a sitting manner, rather than needing to
        stand and move around within the home environment.
