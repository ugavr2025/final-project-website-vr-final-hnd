      <p>ClassVR is an immersive virtual reality learning platform that transports students into a shared digital classroom, replacing isolating video calls with a true sense of presence. Each user is represented by a 3D avatar, fostering genuine social interaction and community, while the professor shares content onto a central virtual whiteboard. To enhance the experience, a persistent chat feature enables real-time peer discussion and provides direct access to an integrated AI assistant capable of instantly answering course-specific questions, ensuring engagement, clarity, and personalized support without disrupting the flow of the lecture.</p>
